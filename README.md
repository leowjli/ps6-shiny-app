# ps6-shiny-app

This app uses student academic performance at two Portuguese schools data published on Kaggle, measuring student performance 
in two distinct categories: *Math and Portuguese,* from two secondary schools: **Gabriel Periera (GP) and Mousinho 
da Silveira (MS).** The data set originates from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and was collected by Prof. Paulo
Cortez at the Department of Information Systems.

The first tab shows a brief description and a small random sample of the data.\
The second tab is a bar plot that shows the correaltion between student health and average grades over 3 periods when there is extra support
vs no extra support of school. Users can select ages 15-22 and the plot will change according to the ages. Users can also choose different
colors to represent extra support, but the colors don't affect the data, meaning it will not change the plot.\
The third tab shows a table of the average grades of each period with a total of 3 periods for male and female students ages 15-22.
The users can select male, female, or both and the table will show the average grades for ages 15-22.
